# L-and-T_Project

Automatic Grass Cutting Robot

i)	Problem statement:

    • To develop an automatic grass cutting robot that cuts excess grass overhead and levels the field
  	• If there is an obstacle in its path, the robot will change its direction
  	• Create a software model of the project in Tinker-cad and simulate it using a designed suitable code

ii)	Scope of the solution:

	• Industrial and High-power appliances can be used to make it suitable for commercial landscaping and farming on dry land.
	• Integrating the grass-cutting application with a rain-sensing facility will allow the robot to sense high moisture content in the soil before moving     further, hence preventing damage.
	• IOT modules can be integrated by sending real-time info on the sensor readings and moisture content of the soil to an online platform.
	• Connecting the system to an application or webpage to control the robot via start, stop and directional buttons helps a user to control the robot manually in case of any visible errors or damage.





iii)	Required Components to develop solutions:

	IDE: Arduino IDE

	Software: Tinker Cad

	Hardware:
    •	Arduino UNO R3
    •	L293 Motor Driver
    •	HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
    •	4-wheel/ 3-wheel mobile base
    •	100KV BLDC motor 
    •	SG-90 Servo motor
    •	Electronic speed control module (ESC) for BLDC
    •	Slide switch
    •	Power source (wired/ battery-powered)
    •	Servo motor tester

iv)	Results of the project:

	• Successfully Made the Tinker cad and EasyEDA circuit of an Automatic Grass Cutting Robot and used them to create the Gerber file.
	• With the functions and examples given in the demo videos in the L&T LMS, created two codes – one for the Tinker cad simulation, and one for the hardware model (Uploaded in GitHub).
	• Made a hardware model of the Grass Cutting robot, following certain safety measures (mentioned in demo).
